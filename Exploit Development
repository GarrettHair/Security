  Stack: A contiguous section of memory used for passing arguments

  Registers: Storage elements as close as possible to the central processing unit (CPU)
  
  Instruction Pointer (IP): a.k.a Program Counter (PC), contains the address of next instruction to be executed
  
  Stack Pointer (SP): Contains the address of the next available space on the stack
  
  Base Pointer (BP): The base of the stack
  
  Function: Code that is separate from the main program that is often used to replace code the repeats in order to make the program smaller and more efficient

  Common GDB commands:

   disass <FUNCTION>   #   Disassemble portion of the program
	
	info <...>  #   Supply info for specific stack areas
	
	x/256c $<REGISTER>  #   Read characters from specific register

	break <address>  #   Establish a break point
