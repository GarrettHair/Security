-Joint Multi-Domain Operations

Space domain - 100km above the earths surface/mean sea level (where atomospheric effects become negligible)

Cyberspace while part of the information enviorment is dependle on the physical domains

Layers of Cyberspace:
  
  Physical Network Layer - consists of IT devices and infastructure in the physical domains that provide storage, transport, and processing of iformation

  Logical Network layer - all the software and things like protocols

  Cyber-persona layer - is a view of cyberspace created by abstracting data from the logical network layer (Logins, account info)

The National Security Act of 1947 - Prescribed a weak SECDEF, Gave legal standing to the JCS, but no chairman.

Goldwater-Nichols Act of 1986 - Adds a chairman to the NSA, he is the sole military advisor to the POTUS and NSC

As the supported commander theyh ave the authority to exercise general direction of supporting effort

the supporting commander determines forces, tactics, methods, procedures, and communications for employment

SEC DEF can assign, allocate, and apportion forces 

Joint operations are military actions conducted by joint forces and those service forces employed in specified command relationshipds with each otehr, which themselves do not establish joint forces

A joint force is one composed of significant elements, assigned or attached, of two or more military departments operating under a single joint force commander 

The information enviorment is the aggregate of social, cultrual, psychological, technical, and physical factors that affect how humans and automated systems derive meaning from, act upon, and are impacted by information

	Informational aspect: the ay individuals, information systems, and groups communicate, and exchange information

	Physical aspect: The matirial characteristics, both natural and manufactured, of the enviorment that may inhibit or enhance communication

	Human Ascpect: The interactions among and between people and the enviroment that shape human behavior and decision making

Information Advantage - The operational advantage gained through the joint force's use of information for decision making and it's ability to leverage inforamtion to create effects on the IE

Cyberspace Operations employ cyberspace capabilities to achive objectives in or through cyberspace

Commanders integrate most CO with other operations to create coordinated and synchonized effects required to support mission accomplishment

Electromagnetic Specrtrum - is a maneuver space essential for facilitating control within operational enviorment and impacts all portions of the OE and military operations

Electronic warfare is broken up into EW attack, EW Support, EW protection

Space operations are operations impacting or direclty utilizing space and ground based capabilites to enhance the otential of United States and multinational partners.

Components of space operations:

	Space situational Awarness 
	Space Control:
		Offensive Space Control
		Defensive Space Control
		Navigation Warfare

	Positioning, Navigation, Reconnaissance
	Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance
	Satellite Communications

Space Domain Elements:
	Physical 
	Network 
	Cognitive

Cyberspace Operations- uses links and nodes in the physical links and nodes located in the physical domain and perform logical functions to create effects first in cyber space

Offensive Cyber operations - Missions intended to project power in and through gray and red cyberspace

D4M:
Deny:
Degrade: a function of AMOUNT
Disrupt: is a function of TIME
Destroy:
Manipulate:

Defensive Cyber Operations - is to defeat the threat of a specific adversary and/or return a comprimised network to a secure and functional state

DOD-IN Operations - Operational actiuons taken to secure, configure, operate, extend, maintanin, and sustain DOD cyberspace and to create and preserve the confidentiality, avalibility, and integrity of the DODIN

The law of armed conflict is made up of customary international Law and treaty law

Treaty Law is comprised of:

	Geneva Law
	Hague Convention
	Developments of treaty law
	Chemical Weapons Convention 

JUS AD BELLUM (Justifacation)

JUS IN BELLO (Control)

CMF - defeats cyberspace threats to the DODIN and the nation

CPT - for internal defense of the DODIN or other blue cyberspace when ordered 

CCMF - support the missions, plans, and priorities of the CCDRs

NMTs are prepared to defend the nation in response to a foreign hostile action or an imminent threat in cyberspace

Vulnerability - A weakness in an information sytem, system security procedures, intern controls or implementation that could be exploited by a threat source

Explotation - A computer network explotation enables operations and intelligence collection capabilities conducted through the use of computer networks to gather networks 

Threat Source - intentional explotation of vulnerability or a situation and method that may accidentally explouit a vulnerability

Initial access is the basis for all network explotation 

Key terrain in cyber space is the same as key terrain in any other domain
